## TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a conceptual framework used to describe the protocols and communication process used on the internet. It is a suite of protocols that define how data is transmitted, routed, and received over the internet. The TCP/IP model consists of four interconnected layers, each responsible for specific tasks:

| Layer                   | Function                                                                                                                | Protocols/Examples                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application Layer       | Provides network services directly to end-user applications.                                                            | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, Telnet                                                                               |
| Transport Layer         | Ensures reliable end-to-end delivery of data between applications.                                                      | TCP, UDP                                                                                                    |
| Internet Layer          | Handles addressing, routing, and fragmentation of data packets across networks.                                         | IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, IGMP, ARP                                                                            |
| Network Interface Layer | Transmits data between devices on the same network and provides access to the physical network medium.                   | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, DSL, ATM, Token Ring                                                                       |

Now, let's provide examples for each layer:

- Application Layer: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for web browsing, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for file transfer, DNS (Domain Name System) is used for domain name resolution, and Telnet is used for remote login.

- Transport Layer: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable and ordered delivery of data, ensuring error-free communication between applications. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) provides faster, connectionless communication but does not guarantee reliability.

- Internet Layer: IP (Internet Protocol) is responsible for addressing and routing packets across networks. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) handles network error reporting, while IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) manages multicast group memberships. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

- Network Interface Layer: This layer deals with the physical transmission of data and includes technologies like Ethernet, Wi-Fi, DSL, ATM, and Token Ring, which provide access to the physical network medium.

The TCP/IP model is the foundation of modern internet communication, with each layer performing specific functions to enable reliable and efficient data transmission across networks.
