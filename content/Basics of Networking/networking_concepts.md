## Networking Concepts



| Concept                   | Explanation                                                                                                                         | Example                                                                                           |

| IP Address                | A unique numerical label assigned to devices on a network, enabling communication between devices.                                | 192.168.0.1                                                                                       |
| Subnet Mask               | A numeric code used with an IP address to determine the network and host portions of the address.                                 | 255.255.255.0                                                                                     |
| Gateway                   | A network node or device that acts as an access point to connect one network to another, allowing communication between networks.   | Router: 192.168.0.254                                                                             |
| DNS (Domain Name System)  | A system that translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites using familiar domain names.             | Domain: www.example.com<br>IP: 192.0.2.1                                                          |
| DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) | A protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration settings to devices on a network.        | DHCP Server: 192.168.0.100<br>Assigned IP: 192.168.0.10                                       |
| Firewall                  | A network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.    | Firewall: Fortinet<br>Block incoming connections on port 22                                      |
| Routing                   | The process of selecting the best path for data packets to travel from a source device to a destination device across a network.    | Source IP: 192.168.0.1<br>Destination IP: 10.0.0.1<br>Router: 192.168.0.254<br>Router: 10.0.0.254 |
| TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)  | A reliable and connection-oriented protocol that provides error checking, sequencing, and flow control for data transmission. | Sending an email over the internet using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)                        |
| UDP (User Datagram Protocol) | A lightweight and connectionless protocol that provides fast, but unreliable, data transmission without error checking or flow control. | Video streaming or online gaming, where real-time data transmission is important                        |

This table provides an overview of various networking concepts, explaining their functions and providing examples. While the corresponding diagrams are omitted in this format, the explanations provide a clear understanding of each concept.
